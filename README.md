# Arkanoid
Final product of a 5-part-semester project in Java.This project was coded by me on the 2nd semester of my 1st year at BIU. I have to say that this project, although its relative simplicity, has Significantly strengthened my OOP and Java skills.


## Compiling and Running
You must have Java SE 10 or higher installed on your machine. Also, you can download the entire source code and run the game via any Java IDEA, and download also the provided biuoop-1.4.jar.
